## Hi! I'm Loïc Dumay! 👋

### I am a web developer 👨💻. 

<p>I'm glad to know that you are interested in my profile. 😉
<br>But for the moment, I just discovered that a secret of github. 🤔
<br>This is the creation of a repository with the same name as your github ID. 😯
<br>Thanks to this, you can see the readme.md of this repository directly on my profile. 🤩
<br>Cool, isn't it? 😎</p>

<p>Oh, but that doesn't give you any more information about myself. 😁
<br>I invite you for the moment to go to my very detailed site. 😊</p>

<p>🌍 => <a target="_blank" href="https://ldumay.fr">https://ldumay.fr</a></p>

<p>Now, I leave you after a few lines, I will continue to code to make all my projects evolve.
<br>So I tell you, see you soon.</p>
