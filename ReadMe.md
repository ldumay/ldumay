## Hi! I'm Loïc Dumay! 👋 🇫🇷

### I am a web developer 👨💻. 

<p>I'm glad to know that you are interested in my profile. 😉
<br>But for the moment, I just discovered a secret of github. 🤔
<br>This is the creation of a repository with the same name as your github ID. 😯
<br>Thanks to this, you can see the readme.md of this repository directly on my profile. 🤩
<br>Cool, isn't it? 😎</p>

<p>Oh, but that doesn't give you any more information about me. 😁
<br>I invite you for the moment to visit my very detailed site <a target="_blank" href="https://ldumay.fr">here</a> 🌍 or even consult all my github repositories. 😊 </p>

<p>Now, I must leave you after this few lines, I will continue to code to make all my projects evolve.
<br>I tell you then, see you soon 😉</p>
